# \<Your Course Title\>

This repository contains documentation, resources, and code for the `<your course title>` session
designed and delivered by `<your names>` of [ICCS](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS).  
All materials, including slides and videos, are available such that individuals can cover the
course in their own time.

A website for this workshop can be found at [\<Link to website or slides if available\>](https://iccs.cam.ac.uk/).

## Learning Objectives

The key learning objective from this workshop is to
_Provide participants with \<Your workshop objective here\>_.

However, more specifically we will achieve this through to:

* add more detailed objectives here,
* list any specific tools and techniques to be used,
* add any other sub-skills that will be covered,
* state what the outcome of the exercises/lecture will be.

With regards to specific content we cover:

* optionally, consider adding specific takeaway skills here
* for example, classification and regression with neural networks
* for example, how to add and commit files to git

## Teaching Material

### Slides
The slides for this workshop can be viewed here: [\<Link to your slides\>](https://iccs.cam.ac.uk/)

### Exercises
The exercises for the course can be found in the [exercises](exercises/) directory.  
These take the form of \<partially completed jupyter notebooks/downloadable code/online tasks or games etc.\>.

### Worked Solutions
Worked solutions for all of the exercises can be found in the [worked solutions](worked-solutions/) directory.  
These are for recapping after the course in case you missed anything, and contain example solutions.


## Preparation and prerequisites

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of the session we assume a basic understanding in a few areas and 
for you to do some preparation in advance.
This expected knowledge is outlined below, along with resources for reading if you
are unfamiliar with any areas.

- List here any key skills or knowledge that will be assumed of a user for the course,
    - for example, basic calculus (integration and differentiation of a function) and matrix algebra
- Provide resources where appropriate,
    - for example, Basic Neural Networks - we recommend the
      [video series by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks), at least chapters 1-3.
- Also include any programming expectations
    - for example, the course will be taught in Python using [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
      and [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html).
        - We assume users are familiar with the basics of Python. This includes:
            - Basic mathematical operations
            - Writing and running scripts/programs
            - Writing and using functions
- If users need to clone the repository from GitHub/Lab using git also note this.
  The [ICCS Summer School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrwzK4CnJ3Q) should provide the necessary knowledge.


### Preparation

List here anything that you expect participants to have on their computer in advance of the course in order to participate.
For example:

- A text editor - e.g. vim/[neovim](https://neovim.io/), [gedit](https://gedit.en.softonic.com/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [sublimetext](https://www.sublimetext.com/) etc. to open and edit code files
- A terminal emulator - e.g. [GNOME Terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/), [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html), [Windows Terminal (windows only)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/), [iTerm (mac only)](https://iterm2.com/)
- A Python 3 installation

Remember that participants will have a mix of Unix and Windows systems, and these should be covered
to ensure smooth delivery. Whilst Unix may be a presumed first choice, provide links to information
for setup on Windows, for example
[Windows' getting-started with python information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners).

If you require assistance or further information with any of these please reach out to
us before the session.


## Installation and setup

Here you should include any instructions required for setup in preparation for the course.
These may be followed during the sesison as a walkthrough, but you should provide clear
instructions here for participants who take longer, needs additional help, or return to work
in their own time.
It is possible that many participants will not have done this in advance,
which you should be prepared for, but having these clear instructions means
that they can be pointed at this instead of holding up the session.

Things to include are:

- obtaining the code, for example instructions on how to clone the code locally:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/<your-repository>.git
  ```
  or fork the repository if this is required.
- Setup of a computing environment if appropriate.
  e.g. in Python:
  ```
  python3 -m venv my-workshop-venv
  source my-workshop-venv/bin/activate
  deactivate
  ```
- Installation of any dependencies
  - Provide links and instructions
  - If using Python, Julia, R etc. package these or use a `requirements.txt` file
- getting started instructions
  - instructions on how to get started with the first exercises of the workshop.
    for example, loading the first jupyter notebook, or building andnrunning the first exercise

Note that you might consider providing a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
or binder implementation that can be run online in case participants have issues using the
code on their local machine. Instructions for this approach should also be provided.
